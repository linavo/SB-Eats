        Isla Vista is located south of Goleta and the west of the University of
        California Santa Barbara. It is the home and hotspot to many students
        who attend UCSB. While the area is well known to many locals, some of
        the most delicious restaurants are located here. From burritos to Korean
        fried chicken, there is a variety of food options for you to choose
        from. <br /><br />
        Not only is the food great, but the Pacific Ocean is only steps away.
        Why not enjoy the delicious food right on the beaches of Isla Vista?
        There are plenty of options that range from breakfast food to great
        hangover food for those you like to enjoy a nice drink at Dublin's Irish
        Pub. The majority of restaurants are all within walking distance from
        each other in downtown Isla Vista.
