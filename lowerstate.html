        Lower State Street in Santa Barbara maybe arguably be the most popular
        area for tourists to visit. From shopping malls to a plethora of
        restaurants and bars, you can't go wrong with exploring here! Since the
        pandemic in 2020, Lower State Street as remained closed to drivers to
        commute back and forth. Instead, the street is now used to allow
        restaurants to provide outdoor seating for visitors to take advantage of
        the great weather. <br />
        <br />
        There are plenty of restaurants that range from brunch to late night
        lounges. For visitors who prefer to enjoy being out in the sun, there
        are plenty of restaurants that provide unlimited mimosas or nice hot
        coffee in the morning. For those who enjoy nightlife as their main
        itinerary of the day, there are plenty of bars and clubs to visit while
        the night is young. Lower State Street is near the wharf where many
        visitors like to go to have a great view of the ocean.
